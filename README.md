# Acid-Rain-Analysis-Prediction-
This project analyzes and predicts acid rain behavior (specifically *pH levels*) across different regions of India using air quality and chemical ion concentration data. The solution includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, machine learning modeling, and clustering to identify pollution hotspots and their correlation.
